# google-airlines

Google created their own airline logos for [google flights](https://www.google.com/flights) for many airlines out there. Enjoy!

I got the IATA codes from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_codes). I used the [`data.js`](./data.js) script to read the contents of the wikipedia table and export it to a JSON file. I copy the contents of the JSON file to a TypeScript file so it can be used in the app.

- This is just a fun side project for me.
- All data and photos are property of Google.
